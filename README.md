# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem Definition

## Design Statement
I will design an innovative web application that will allow connecting tutors and students to offer/seek their services easier. The development will be done using the software Flask framework in Python, CSS, and HTML. It will take around 10 weeks to develop and will be evaluated according to the success criteria stated below by the client.

## Rationale for Proposed Solution
To provide more exposure for the local places and prevent them from running out of business, I have decided to make a web applicaton that would serve as a place where people could connect with others through sharing interesting local places, culinary experiences and astonsihing nature that one city has to offer.

### Why Web Application?
Web applications are more adequate when developing a social network like the one I am making because it allows easier access and sharing of information across multiple devices without the need for downloading and installing an application. Users can simply access the website through a web browser on their desktop or mobile devices. THis increases the potential audience size as makes it easier for users to share their experiences with others. Lastly, a web applications can be maintained easily and can be optimized for search engines, making it easier for new users to discover and join the social network.

### Why Python?
Python contains many versatile features, which make it a better choice compared to other languages, for example PHP[^2]. Python's Flask framework is ideal for developing social network websites due to its lightweight and flexible nature [^3]. Flask's simplicity and ease of use make it an excellent choice for this project, allowing developers to focus on the website's core features and functionality. It also offers a range of libraries and extensions, making it easier to implement complex features such as authentication and database connectivity, when compared to its competitors such as PHP or ruby [^4]. With Python's object-oriented programming, developers can write code that is easy to read, modify, and maintain, which is essential when creating a complex web application such as a social network website. Additionally, Python has an active community of developers who offer support and resources, making it easier to learn and develop with the language.

### Why SQL?
To store the vast amounts of data needed for a social network website, a reliable and efficient database is essential. While non-SQL databases can be an option, SQL databases offer several advantages that make them better suited for this purpose. The main advantage of SQL databases is their ability to handle large amounts of data efficiently, thanks to their relational structure[^5]. The relational structure of SQL databases makes it easier to manage and query data, as it is stored in tables. This feature also ensures that data is consistent and accurate, as it is subject to strong data integrity constraints[^6]. With all the data that is being stored for this social network website, an SQL database is essential to ensure efficient data handling and management.

### Why HTML?
HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages and it provides the structure and content of a website[^7]. HTML is more widely supported than other alternatives such as Flash, making it a better choice for cross-platform compatibility[^8]. Additionally, HTML is more search engine friendly than other technologies such as JavaScript, which can lead to better search engine rankings[^9].
